/**
 As mentioned in the header, the intention is that all access to the multi
 is controlled via our internal serial queue. The queue also protects additions to
 and removals from our array of the transfers that we're managing.

 The CURL multi handle is generally not stored by the CURLMUlti object. 
 Instead it is set up when the dispatch timer is created, and it's value is
 captured by the timer block, which passes it on to everything else that needs it.
 
 The one (annoying) exception to this is that the socket_callback from curl
 only has one context value, which we use to pass a pointer to the CURLMulti
 object. Since the code called by this callback needs access to the multi value,
 we have to store it on CURLMulti - using the multiForSocket property.
 
 However, these callbacks only occur as a result of calling curl_multi_socket_action(),
 which only happens from within the processMulti: call. Therefore, we only set
 multiForSocket at the start of the processMulti call, and we clear it again at the end.

 The other GCD structures (self.timer and self.queue) should stay valid until they are destroyed
 as part of the shutdown process. 
 
 # Shutdown
 
 Shutdown just cancels the timer, and removes our reference to it. All other cleanup happens
 in the timer's cancel handler. This removes all easy handles from the multi, cleans it up, and
 disposes of it. It then releases the queue.
 
 Because the timer and the queue blocks both contain references to self, the object itself
 should not get deallocated until both the timer and queue have gone away. 
 
 Since the timer block is the only thing that actually causes activity on the multi, 
 once the timer has been cancelled, nothing else should actually touch the multi,
 other than the cleanup block.

 The queue itself is cleaned up on the main queue, once the rest of the shutdown process has finished.
 This additional paranoia (using the main queue for the cleanup) is probably not strictly necessary any more.
