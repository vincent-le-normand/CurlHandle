/**
 * Wrapper for a curl_multi handle.
 * Roughly analogous to NSURLSession for curl.
 *
 * CURLProtocol uses the global sharedInstance to implement the NSURLRequest/NSURLConnection 
 * integration.
 *
 * There's nothing to stop you making other instances if you want to - it's just not really necessary, particularly
 * as we don't expose the curl multi externally.
 *
 * This class works by setting up a serial GCD queue to process all events associated with the multi. We add
 * gcd dispatch sources for each socket that the multi makes, and use them to notify curl when something
 * happens that needs attention.

/**  Loading respects as many of NSURLRequest's built-in features as possible, including:
    * An HTTP method of @"HEAD" turns on the CURLOPT_NOBODY option, regardless of protocol (e.g. handy for FTP)
    * Similarly, @"PUT" turns on the CURLOPT_UPLOAD option (again handy for FTP uploads)

    * Supply -HTTPBody or -HTTPBodyStream to switch Curl into uploading mode, regardless of protocol

    * Custom Range: HTTP headers are specially handled to set the CURLOPT_RANGE option, regardless of protocol in use
      (you should still construct the header as though it were HTTP, e.g. bytes=500-999)

    * Custom Accept-Encoding: HTTP headers are specially handled to set the CURLOPT_ENCODING option

  Delegate messages are delivered on the specified queue

  Redirects are *not* automatically followed. If you want that behaviour, NSURLConnection is likely a better match for your needs
